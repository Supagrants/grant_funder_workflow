## Competitive Analysis
Competitors like Replika and Character.AI provide AI-driven companions but lack on-chain interoperability, NFT customization, and user ownership. Our edge lies in Web3 compatibility, NFT linkage, and custom AI-driven growth. Alterim AI offers users full ownership of their companions and the ability to trade, customize, and co-own them — a competitive differentiator in Web3.

## Public Good Impact
Alterim AI democratizes AI ownership by giving users control over their AI companions as on-chain, tradeable assets. It provides open access to AI-driven customization, enhances NFT utility, and creates a marketplace for user-generated AI experiences. This empowers NFT creators, developers, and end-users to benefit from collective network effects and decentralized user-driven growth.
